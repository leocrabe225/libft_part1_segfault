# libft_part1_segfault
This repo is a tester for most of segfaults in the part One of libft (a 42 project)

To use this script, you have to change the path of your libft in the file "exe.sh" at line 3.   
Then use the following command : "bash exe.sh"

(Strrchr takes a long time to be checked, it's a normal behavior)   
(Strncmp does not have the same results on every computer,  
the only important part is for your to have the same sign that the original function)
